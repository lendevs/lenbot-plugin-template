# LenBot plugin template

[中文](README.md)

A working counter plugin to start your own LenBot plugin from.

## Getting started

1. Click Use this template on GitHub to create your repository.
2. Change `name`, `authors`, `version` and `license` in `plugin.toml`.
3. Rename the commands and tools so they don't collide with other plugins.

## What the example does

- `/计数` reads the count for the current group.
- `计数加一` adds the configured `step`.
- `/计数清零` resets it.
- The `counter_read` tool returns the current count without sending a message.

Counts are stored per group and survive source updates.

## Testing

```sh
uv run --no-sync pytest -q tests
```

Tests use the host's `PluginTest` harness to simulate messages and configuration, so LenBot does not need to run. CI installs the host version pinned in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`; update it when you move to a newer host.

## Releasing

1. Bump the version in `plugin.toml` and commit.
2. Push a `v*` tag. The workflow builds a ZIP and attaches it to a GitHub Release.

Users can install from the repository URL with Git in the panel, or import the ZIP from the Release. Document configuration or data format changes in the README; rolling back source does not roll back stored data.

See `developer/plugins-v1.en.md` in the host repository for the interface, lifecycle and configuration.

## License

The template is [GPL-3.0-only](LICENSE). The LenBot host is AGPL-3.0-only and plugins run in the host process, so GPL-3.0 is the recommended plugin license; if you choose another license, check its compatibility with GPLv3 and AGPLv3.
